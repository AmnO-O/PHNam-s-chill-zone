Yo I'm back =))). Long time see.

I often wonder why people don’t just say what they mean. It feels like we’re all playing a complex guessing game, trying to know the hidden ‘signs’.

## The story of B and T
This feeling brings a story about one of my friends to mind. I’ll call him B. He’s a freshman who after his first semester, took a part-time job at a factory to earn some money. It was there he met a new friend, a girl I’ll call T.

After just a few conversations, B thought T gave him a sign. He told me that T was really kind and cute, and he couldn’t stop wondering if she was giving him a sign. And I felt like I was his coach :)). You know the quote : The coach doesn’t play !. So I gave B some advice like : “you need to wait, it’s not what you think it is”. And everyday, B went to work, he always hoped that he could meet T and talk with her. At the end of the day, he waited until T did her work so that he could strike up a conversation. To be specific, T is the same age as B and also a university student and works part-time.

Day by day, they kept talking after work, and it seemed like B was really into T. But then one day, when B visited her workplace, he saw T texting on her phone. Her co-worker said that T was really interested in a new guy at the office. In an instant, all the hope B had for her vanished. He felt his day was completely ruined. Just when he thought things couldn't get any worse, T replied to her co-worker, “Đến trước nhưng cơ hội sau” Feeling like he had no chance at all, he didn't know what to do. That was the last time they ever spoke.

Wow, I was surprised. If T’s co-worker hadn’t told, B would not have known that T already had a crush or some other 'michelin boy' :))). And B was just in a queue waiting for his turn :))).

So nothing is clear, even if you think your crush gave you some signs, because no, they also do those things with many, many, many other people :))). But having a crush is like something you lack information about.. What you like about that person is just your imagination of them. Things are just not clear. “She definitely gives you a sign … it’s just an EXIT SIGN =)))” I told B. There is a song called “Ngã tư không đèn”. I feel like it really fits this situation.

## Probability and Ice cream
I am going to have a course named military education aka “đi quân sự”. Reading some reviews about it makes me feel a little nervous though =)). But there’s a rumor that if I eat 10 banana ice creams, I will have a girlfriend :)). I know it’s not really believable , but who cares just do it 🐧🐧. And here is a fact : 

Assume that the probability that you will have a girlfriend (or boyfriend) in one year is p. If one year passes and you still don’t have one, the probability for the next year is still p.

Hope that I will have a girlfriend after eating 10 banana ice creams :))).
