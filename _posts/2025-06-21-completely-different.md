## Why something new? {#section1}

Well, I think I would start writing something different. The old one was stuck, and I still don't know how to continue that story. Maybe I'll write it later, but for now, I've decided to change and focus on something new.

I used to think that spending time writing anything was just a waste of time. However, I'm now going to try writing in English in order to sharpen my writing skills.

## The Inspiration {#section2}

So, my upcoming posts won't be anything special - just raw texts about my daily life. I'm starting this new habit because I recently read some posts by my cousin, who's now in America, and he has written all of his posts in English. When I read them, I found it really interesting. I've also recently read one of the books he recommended in his posts.

## A Change in Perspective {#section3}

When I was in eighth grade, I was really deeply interested in English. But during the summer of eighth grade, one of my older seniors told me that English is just a language. He questioned whether specializing in English was good. At that time, I thought he was right, and I started learning Math instead of focusing on English. From that point on, I didn't dedicate much time to learning English.

Nevertheless, I now have a different point of view. I think: *"Why don't I sharpen my skills to become an expert? At least enough to achieve an IELTS 7.5!"* Recently, as I scrolled, I saw that one of my friends is now studying at **"Bắc Đại"** (Peking University). This makes me feel it's time to change for the better. It's time to mature!

## Real-life Connections {#section4}

I think I spend too much time using social platforms such as Facebook, Messenger, etc. I wondered whether I should give up spending time on Facebook. So yes, I have spent less time on it since that day. 

I realize that I should do more meaningful things which help me gain more experience. In Messenger, I can easily text anyone, but when it came to face-to-face conversations in life or just Google Meet, my mouth felt stiff and all I could do was just an awkward smile. 

So the first thing I think I should change is going outside and talking more with people in real life or via Google Meet. 

**So you 🫵, do you have the same thoughts as me? ._.**
