It's been 7 days since I quit Facebook and I feel completely fine. It turns out I don't have a fear of missing out (FOMO). So, I challenged myself not to use Messenger, and today is day one.

After, I had a quick glance of my Facebook profile and realized that I have roughly 250 friends. I wondered whether I knew them all. Of course, I don't. I asked myself whether people need many friends. Although I have 250 friends, I don't actually text more than two people per day. Sometimes, I text none of them. I think if you try my challenge, you'll feel it's so damn quiet. I think it's okayyy, because the older generation, like my parents, didn't use any digital devices when they were my age. So, it will also be a chance for me to experience what life was like for my parents back then.

Looking through my friend list, I saw many people, whom I'll call "người nổi tiếng" have around double the number of friends I do. And some, whom I'll call "người lowkey" have fewer friends than I have, haha. I have to admit that many people on my friend list, I haven't even texted or known well. I really admire people who have many friends and have the confidence to post or share things (such as posts, stories, ..) on their profile. Like, they don't really care about what people think about them. And I think it's a great attitude because even though people might judge others, they often only remember such events less than 2 days. If 2 days have passed and they still remembered, you would be considered a special person in their mind. I think so :)).

However, exposing too much information is also not a good idea. Like, internet fraud (also known as "đào lửa") they might know your characteristics so well and understand what you're aiming for. So it may be a potential threat to you. Therefore, you should not post things that are too personal.

Well, in the virtual world, we can't trust anyone. One of my friends is the same age as me. Sometimes, he told me that he received strange friend requests (he didn't know who they were) and he always texted to them. "Loving through the internet is not real bro. You don't know who that person is so it doesn't guarantee anything. Real people real connections (người thật hàng thật) are always better." I said to him. I also have another friend; people keep sending friend requests for him but he keeps putting them in the queue or waitlist (ngậm follow). "That seems so arrogant (chảnh), doesn't it?" I asked him. He said that if he accepted the friend request and they wouldn't have communication beyond just seeing each other's profile and it didn't make any sense.

Well, this has been a quite lengthy blog, hasn't it? Three weeks have passed, and I'll be going back to study soon, so I probably won't be writing anything for a while (maybe until September). This might seem irrelevant to this topic, but I heard someone else that I know (though not very well) is going to study abroad. I just thought "WOW; well people keep improving and developing; good for them, I also need to try hard too." I hope that both you (everyone who reads this post) 🫵 and I will always keep moving forward and improving day by day. In Philosophy, there is a thing called ... I want to write more but maybe in other topics. I think I'm like a mayfly (thiêu thân) always heading toward where the light shines. There is a song named "kẻ theo đuổi ánh sáng" But I think calling it "kẻ theo đuổi ánh dương" sounds more poetic :)). So what is the quote of the month? It's "Do july me?"
